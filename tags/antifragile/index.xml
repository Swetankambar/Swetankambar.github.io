      <description>Barry Schwartz wrote The paradox of choice in 2004, and its relevance is indubitable today in 2020. The argument that probably most of us would be happy if there are a lesser number of choices has increased its relevance over time. The current age is of an apparent abundance, and like the real devil, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a problem. If anything, it feels like the happiest time of our lives because we need not think twice to get what we want.</description>

      <description>Conversation between Socrates and Fat Tony Antifragile is a great idea and one without which life can/must/should not be imagined, and nnt has made the book so real and original that it almost feels like talking to a person. I have had my conflicts with the book at places. This is an alternate interpretation of a dialogue between Fat Tony and Socrates in Chapter 17.
Fat Tony: Get lost socrates, You are asking me to define what is the difference between pious and non pious, do I really need to be able to tell you what it is to be able to conduct a pious action?</description>
