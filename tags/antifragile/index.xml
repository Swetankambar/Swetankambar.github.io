&lt;p>Antifragile is a great idea and one without which life can/must/should not be imagined, and nnt has made the book so real and original that it almost feels like talking to a person. I have had my conflicts with the book at places. This is an alternate interpretation of a dialogue between &lt;strong>Fat Tony&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Socrates&lt;/strong> in Chapter 17.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fat Tony&lt;/strong>: Get lost socrates, You are asking me to define what is the difference between pious and non pious, do I really need to be able to tell you what it is to be able to conduct a pious action?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
