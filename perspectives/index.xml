The argument that probably most of us would be happy if there are a lesser number of choices has increased its relevance over time.
The current age is of an apparent abundance, and like the real devil, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a problem. If anything, it feels like the happiest time of our lives because we need not think twice to get what we want.
