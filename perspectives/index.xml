      <description>Barry Schwartz wrote The paradox of choice in 2004, and its relevance is indubitable today in 2020. The argument that probably most of us would be happy if there are a lesser number of choices has increased its relevance over time. The current age is of an apparent abundance, and like the real devil, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a problem. If anything, it feels like the happiest time of our lives because we need not think twice to get what we want.</description>

      <description>Conversation between Socrates and Fat Tony Antifragile is a great idea and one without which life can/must/should not be imagined, and nnt has made the book so real and original that it almost feels like talking to a person. I have had my conflicts with the book at places. This is an alternate interpretation of a dialogue between Fat Tony and Socrates in Chapter 17.
Fat Tony: Get lost socrates, You are asking me to define what is the difference between pious and non pious, do I really need to be able to tell you what it is to be able to conduct a pious action?</description>

      <description>Management  Time Management: To make promise to people and to ensure that you deliver each one of them. There is no such learnable skill as time-management, it is an expression of integrity. Anger Management: Have a control loop running in the background that checks evaluates the cause of anger. In many cases, it is the fear that something might be true and unpleasant at the same time. At many other times, it is our own expectations that make us angry.</description>
