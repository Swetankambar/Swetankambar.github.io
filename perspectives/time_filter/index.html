  <p>Barry Schwartz wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice">The paradox of choice</a> in 2004, and its relevance is indubitable today in 2020. The argument that probably most of us would be happy if there are a lesser number of choices has increased its relevance over time.
The current age is of an apparent abundance, and like the real devil, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a problem. If anything, it feels like the happiest time of our lives because we need not think twice to get what we want.
To all those who don&rsquo;t think this is a real issue, this article is not for you. It is not an argument to prove the problem of abundance or the paradox of having a large number of choices. For others, one of my method to diminish the damage to my attention span, focus and happiness is by  using time as a filter. This implies using a time threshold to decide whether to consume something or not. This is like putting a low pass filter that will let only slow varying things to pass, and attenuate anything that is changing suddenly. This approach works well to decide things like :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Watching content for entertainment:</em> As Netflix, Amazon and the likes are working hard to create content that is both appealing and congenial to everyone on the internet, this method is like an antidote to the disease of loss of focus and attention. My first rule of thumb is to segregate genres that I want to watch. Then I want to watch only the best of them and for this part-time acts as a low pass filter. So I decided to watch the things which have been existing for years and still are relevant to the context. This leads me to choose from less than 1% of the list that most of the lists shortlist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Spending time on social media:</em> Here time can be used as a filter to help us evaluate what is the utility of a platform to myself. The test is simple, try to minimize the indulgence on a certain platform and try to see how much of a loss does it causes to oneself. The loss can be in terms of sadness because one is not in touch with one&rsquo;s loved ones, can be in form of a loss of ego because there is no one to give a social validation, it can be in economic terms for influencers and bloggers. So, shut down all the social media sites at once and try to see which one do you need the most. Then activate only that platform and set thresholds for yourself on how much involvement you can have. Keep increasing the threshold until you hit just a sweet-spot balance.
Like all calibration procedures, this will get a stray and off mark in some time, hence repeat the calibration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Buying clothes, groceries, and all things which you replenish:</em> For this one, the idea of being a satisficer hits the mark. There is no dearth of new brands coming up in the market with yet another improvement in taste, quality, or price. Putting time as another filter here, the thing that has been working for you till now will probably work for you even in near future. So, to simplify things, write down the brands of things that you like and stick to it till it does not become worsen. Whenever there is a new advertisement for a better alternative, you can ignore it because you already have an option that works. Use the time to test for incumbency and then stick to the decision until you see a change in the assessed state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is another class of things that use time as a high pass filter. For this class of things, you need to update yourself else the old model will perish. Things in this class grow when they are disturbed and you need to devote time and attention to updating the information that you have. Let&rsquo;s see some of these as well next.</p>
<p>For example, take professional skills. If you are in any professional role which utilizes technical tools or skills, it is worth following the old advice of sharpening your tool before you attempt to cut a tree. Spending time on learning new tools will save a lot of time that you currently spend on menial labor. For example, moving to <strong>vim/ markdown</strong> from word or to <strong>Hugo</strong> based blogging from WordPress can help you save both mental energy and your precious time.</p>
<p>Other things in this class will be your friends and family. While it is easy to be a sloth and meet your friends only on your birthdays, and your family only during a festival or vacation, it leads a very fast degradation on what you know about them. Everything is changing fast and one needs to devote time and energy to people one cares about. And for long term happiness, this is a useful exercise.</p>
<p>So, this is a small thought-action experiment that I think can help us better utilize the 24 hours that we have and help in leading a happier, successful, and less stressful life.</p>
